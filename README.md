# Dog-Themed Calculator App üê∂ 
This is a basic calculator web app styled with a transparent button layout and a background photo of my dog. It performs standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The layout mimics the look and feel of the lowkey phone calculator, with all basic features implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
